# GharPeCampus (Prototype)

## Problem Statement
Since the pandemic started, the first year students of our college have not seen and experienced the campus atmosphere. GharPeCampus is mainly for them so that they can find everything a student does being in the campus on a single platform.

## Features
### 1. CHARCHA
It is a discussion platform for the college insiders in which a registered student can ask or answer questions based upon any topic.
### 2. PARIKSHA
In this page, links to all the materials (exam-schedule, syllabus, books, notes, and YouTube playlists) and all the things that a student requires to pass the semester with flying colors in the minimal time have been provided.
#### 2.1 PARIKSHA PE CHARCHA
It is a platform in which students can video chat for group studies in the exam times. This video call feature has been integrated using AGORA API.
### 3. CAMPUS GHOOMO
This page provides gallery to all the locations inside the campus.

## Technology Stack Used
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AGORA SDK 

## How to run the project on your local machine?
### Step 1
Clone the GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop or download the zip folder from the public repository.
### Step 2
Run npi i command in CLI
### Step 3
Run node app.js 
### Step 4
Open a browser (preferrably Google Chrome) on your local machine and start localhost:3000

## Future Scope
1. Adding upvote/downvote buttons for answers posted to various questions on CHARCHA. 
2. Adding a page for Alumni network in the same platform.
3. Implementing screen sharing in video conferencing.
